      “absolutely fantastic. It is unique and worth your time...I love this visual style...it hit me with nostalgia in a way that a lot of these...'nostalgic' games just don't do for me”

      “Its emphasis on conflict between humanoid-sized opponents makes for a pleasingly different feel to many other shoot ’em ups out there, and the feeling of gathering allies to fight alongside you as you progress is consistently enjoyable and satisfying.”

## Artistic statement
Demonizer is my most personally meaningful work. Bringing together all that I love and believe in - exhilarating gameplay, charming fantasy characters, the ideal of peace and justice for all - Demonizer indulges a fantasy of changing hateful hearts and minds, and presents an ode to the outcast and oppressed youth fighting the cruelty and injustice of the old world.
