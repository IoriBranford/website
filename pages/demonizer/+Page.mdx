      "Its emphasis on conflict between humanoid-sized opponents makes for a pleasingly different feel to many other shoot ‚Äôem ups out there, and the feeling of gathering allies to fight alongside you as you progress is consistently enjoyable and satisfying."

      "combines excellent gameplay, an unexpected premise, terrific visuals, an exciting soundtrack, and with it a somber story about war and family into one 8-stage shmup game....a novel twist on the dynamics of humans and demons."

  # Artistic statement
  Demonizer is my most personally meaningful work. Bringing together all that I love and believe in - exhilarating gameplay, charming fantasy characters, the ideal of peace and justice for all - Demonizer indulges a fantasy of changing hateful hearts and minds, and presents an ode to the outcast and oppressed youth fighting the cruelty and injustice of the old world.
